# spotify-mix

## Idea
The idea of Spotify was to allow multiply people to contribute to the same playlist via a 'room'. This means it could be used to allow everyone to "DJ" at social gatherings.

The room would allow admins control over the playlist - but also allow guests to contribute to the playlist. It was a means to learn React initially, and I have left it at skeleton version of allowing one user to add and remove songs to a playlist. It has been refactored to use TypeScript and Context in order to develop my learning. However, I have decided to build out another application - Friendly Competition, as a fun side-project to drive people to their goals.
